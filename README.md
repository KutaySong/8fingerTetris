( Project Name: 8 Finger Tetris Clone )


## Example Usage

Press ';' with your right pinky then press D+F with your left hand fingers. 
The piece should be vertically rotated (center of mass) and placed rightmost.
When you release your left fingers the piece drops.

# PURPOSE

Rotating and Sliding of Tetramino blocks is a headache for decades.
Cause of thousand billion fails !!

I wondered if it is possible to have a different kinf of control by using only 8 keyboard keys:

## Controls
- Single button for SLIDING. Since there are total 10 columns in the original game.

 1  2  3  4   5    6     7  8  9   10
[Q, W, E, R, Q+R, J+';', J, K, L, ';']


- Multiple buttons for ROTATION
Primarily 3 buttons are used symmetrically either [S, D, F] or [J, K, L]

Middle + Right      = Vertical state, Lower Ledge located to selected Column oriented Rightwise
Middle + Left       = Vertical state, Lower Ledge located to selected Column oriented Leftwise
Left + Right        = Horizontal state, Ledge looks above
Left + Middle+ Right= Horizontal state, Ledge looks below


- Release of multiple buttons for DROP
